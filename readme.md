## Summary ##

"InCanon" uses a relational database to collaboratively build a compendium of
all the people, places, and things that animate a role-playing campaign setting.

Players and Game Masters can join their own shared campaign in which everyone
views the index of notable entries as their home page, and anyone can add new information.

Schema are available on scratchpad.txt, and several campaigns have
already been populated with some real game data.
